Inspiration
To make this project, we largely wanted to enter the maker & education tracks. As we brainstormed ideas, we talked about how all of us were in high school during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we had different experiences with quarantine, we all struggled with high school labs---some of us attempted (and failed) to do them virtually, while others couldn't do them at all. As such, we sought to code tech for good by making labs more accessible for everyone, especially experiments that require state-of-the-art equipment.

What it does
This project allows a student to complete a chemistry (NMR) experiment in virtual reality (VR). The student is given instructions in the VR landscape. The student must calculate the correct amount of each chemical to pipette into a bowl. The student must then mix it, and place a sample on the NMR machine. If everything goes to plan, the student will see a NMR spectra that corresponds to the chemical they synthesized (a Schiff base).

How we built it
We built this in Unity using the C# language. To make objects, we used Blender. For our VR headset, we used Meta 2 Quest.

Challenges we ran into
We struggled a lot to get the gripping physics working, especially collisions. The code wouldn't recognize that we were colliding with other objects (a pipette, a bowl), so we spent a lot of time debugging that. We eventually figured it out, but because we spent so much time on this we weren't able to implement other features in the time allotted.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're very proud that we got the gripping physics working, as this was the core of our project. We're also proud of how we made objects to put into the game. For example, we hand-made (aka no downloaded prefabs) a NMR spectrometer in Blender; none of us had any experience in Blender, so this was super cool!

What we learned
We learned a lot about Unity, VR, and C#. In addition, we learned how to better debug issues in our code.

Ethics
Our project is intentionally ethical because there is a lot of waste that goes into certain lab experiments after it is finished. Making things virtual saves money, resources, and potential solutions for common experiments that are used to teach student key concepts. Additionally, lab accidents can be dangerous and are prevented in the virtual setting.

What's next for Accessible Labs
Since we only had 24 hours, a first step would be to polish the current experiment. This can be done by adding more chemicals, pipettes, and equipment; we also would like to code more potential outcomes (ie, what if you overflow a pipette?). In addition, we'd like to make more virtual lab experiments with more state-of-the-art equipment so more students can participate in incredible labs virtually.

We used blender to make our NMR Spectroscopy lab. We were inspired by previous code from various labs in the Augmented and virtual reality class.
